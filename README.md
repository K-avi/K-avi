-  Hi, I’m @K-avi
-  I'm an undergrad CS student at Sorbonne Université 
-  I'm back from my vacations 
-  I really like coding in C 
-  I'm interrested in theoretical computer science and how you design/create programming languages but I don't know much about either of these topics yet
-  sometimes I also do silly things with graphs
-  I'm planning on learning/ getting better at functionnal languages (I already know some OCaml but I'd like to learn Haskell and/or Clsip)
-  I'd also like to learn Rust at some point
-  If u wanna reach me email me at:  i.m-r.ecole@orange.fr
