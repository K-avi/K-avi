-  Hi, I’m @K-avi
-  I'm an undergrad college student in Computer Science at Sorbonne Université in France
-  I really like coding in C 
-  I'm interrested by theoretical computer science and how you design/create programming languages but I don't know much about either of these yet
-  I'm planning on learning/ getting better at functionnal languages (I already know some OCaml but I'd like to learn Haskell n Clsip)
-  If u wanna reach me email me at:  i.m-r.ecole@orange.fr
